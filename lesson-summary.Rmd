![__Open Science Principles from DataTrieste19__](img/open-science.jpeg)

-----

## Consider the Open Science principles we discussed on Monday as you reflect on two questions:


- When you think about reading up on the latest findings in your area, what causes you frustration with the current mode of scholarly communication? 

- What features would you like to see in research publishing?

-----

## Vision of the Executable, Reproducible Paper of the future

- [Everpub: A submission for the Open Science Prize](https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/blob/master/README.md) 
    - Proposed by researchers Tim Head and Titus Brown, developers of Binder
- ["Literate Programming" example by Eglen, Weeks, et al, GigaScience, December 2014](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/3/1/2047-217X-3-3/2682913)
    - View in split mode
    - Refer to section "Availability of supporting data" to see links to supplementary `R` code, data, etc.  
- [E-life's first reproducible article](https://repro.elifesciences.org/example.html#)
    - Note the dynamic version served in Binder (built on the fly)
    - Note that for each plot there appears a reference to an `Rscript` that generated the figure

## What are the Components of Open Authorship?

- Text based authoring with text-based mark up
- Integration of text, code, plots, data in one coherent compendium, or in a persistently linked set of curated resources dispersed across multiple sites (eg publisher site, GitHub Repository, Protocols.io)
- Use of open source tools and platforms
    - Plain text
    - Latex
    - HTML
    - Markdown
    - Pandoc

#### What are the Benefits for Authors of Writing in plain text?  
 
#### What are the Benefits for Readers/Re-users of Writing in plain text?

# How to Get Started with Open Authoring? Return to the command line!

See Etherpad for 
1. Instructions to install pandoc on your desktop PC
1. instructions on creating your own GitHub repository for this lesson, and cloning the student files to your desktop computer. 

Once `pandoc` and the student files are installed locally, follow these steps:

View the text file with the content we are going to markup for our reproducible research report. Then use `pandoc` to convert it from `.txt` to `.md` format; and from .md to .html format

```
$ ls
$ more DMP0.txt
$ pandoc DMP0.txt -s -o DMP0.md
$ more DMP0.md
$ pandoc DMP0.md -s -o DMP0.html
$ more DMP0.html
```

Open web browser to view the rendered version of the report. (Once inside the browser, press control-O (Oh) to view the files on your local directory). How does the web page look?

Let's convert the document one more time to `.docx` in case your advisor wants a clean copy of the report printed out.

```
$ pandoc DMP0.html -s -o DMP0.docx
$ more DMP0.docx
```
How does this file look on your computer? Can you read it? Why or why not?

Open Office on your computer and view the file from that application. Look okay now?

Before leaving the command line for RStudio, let's back up our files to GitHub.

```
$ git add *
$ git commit -m "Uploading pandoc outputs to GitHub"$ git push
```

Now view your GitHub repository to see the newly created files appear there

# Gaining more power and options in RStudio

1. Launch RStudio
1. Select File ->  a New project
1. Select Existing directory
1. Navigate to the folder with your lesson files
1. Create the Project
1. Open file `DMPO.md' in your R Markdown panel
1. Do you see an option for `knitr1` at the top of the panel?
1. Save the file as `DMPO.Rmd` -- now do you see the option for `knitr` at the top of the panel?
1. Edit the top portion of the document between the three dashes -- this is the YAML [^ Yet Another Markup Language] header that provides instructions to pandoc and to knitr

```
---
author: "Your Name"
title: "My Data Management Plan"
date: "8 August, 2019"
output: html_document
---
```

In the body of the document, markup the headings to distinguish between sections of the DMP

Insert `# ` before the main heading
Insert `## ` before each section heading

Save the file as `DMP1.Rmd` but do not close

Press the `knit` button to render the document as a web page. Did any of the YAML information appear? How do the headings look?

Now `knit` to Word. How does the document look in Office?

Now one last knit, but this time to a slide deck you can show via a Web browser

Revise the YAML output statement as follows:

```
output: slidy_presentation
```

Save the change with control-S and then look at the options on the `knit` menu -- select the option for slidy and see what happens!

Can you tell what element(s) in the `DMP1.Rmd` file were used to tell pandoc to insert slide breaks?

Save these changes as `DMP2.Rmd` and take a stretch break -- you earned it!

# Markdown that controls appearance

## Lists

- Bulleted List (Navigate to Section 1 of the report and insert a dash and space `- ` before each sentence. Save the changes and `knit` to html.
- Bulleted List with Nesting. Use the _4 space rule_ to further indent the last three sentences in the list. Save and `knit` to Word
- Numbered List (Navigate to Section 5 and turn each sentence into a numbered list item by inserting a 1, period, and space `1. `before each sentence)
- Numbered List with Nesting (Can you figure out how to further indent the last 2 list items with alphabetical letters?). Save the changes and `knit` to HTML and Word.

## Font styles

Navigate to Section 3 and make the following changes to font style:

- Put the phrase 'New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission' into _italics_ using the underscore character `_`. This is just for emphasis and is not necessary in many cases. But can you think of any important reasons when certain text strings must be put in _italics_ to convey special meaning?
- Emphasize the word 'public' by putting it in __boldface__ with two underscore characters. This is also not necessary most of the time; it just demonstrates how to markup text when you prefer to add __strong emphasis__.
- Subscripts are produced by surrounding the character to drop lower in the tilde character `~`. Try adding the formula for water next to the word 'water' in Section 3.

Navigate to Section 2 for the following markup

- Text that represents `computer code` or other `technical terms` can be produced by surrounding the word or phrase with backticks. This symbol is found above the tilde on your keyboard. It is not the same character as the apostrophe! Represent the phrases 'Microsoft Access Database'; ESRI ArcGIS; and '.txt' as `computer code`
- Add hyperlinks for websites using the syntax. Make sure there is no extra space between the bracket and the parenthesis. 

```
[Name of link](insert url)

```

Save your changes and `knit` to see the results.

## Inline Image

Navigate to the main heading at the top of the report and add a Background section with a Level2 header. Below the new heading type in a sentence: "The field area of this investigation is illustrated below." Then make room to insert an inline figure representing a map of the study area. The image file to insert is inside the `img` folder in your directory.

---

```
![Figure 1](img/rio-grande-basin.png)

```

 Save the file as `DMP3.Rmd` and `knit` the file to see how the image appears in both HTML and Word. 
 
 To try decreasing the dimensions of the image (the default is 5 x 7), add two new lines into your YAML below the output statements, as follows:
 
 ```
 output:
  html_document: default
    fig_width: 2
    fig_height: 4
   word_document: default
    fig_width: 2
    fig_height: 4
---
```

# Adding Academic Features
 
__Footnotes__

In Section 2, mark up the last sentence of the section as a footnote using the following markup:

```
^[The FGDC standard was chosen...all the way to end of sentence]
```
Save the changes and  `knit`. Where does the footnote appear?

 
__Citations__

Adding citations is a powerful feature of Markdown and Pandoc but requires a few steps to perform.

1. Make sure you have a well formed `references.bib` file in the file directory. It must contain all the necessary citations represented in `.bibtex` format.
1. Navigate to a sentence that needs a citation at the end. 
    a. In the 'Background' section, add a citation for the map by inserting the markup `[Source: @Bartolino_1979]`
    b. In Section 4, Paragraph 2, insert a citation after the sentence ending with 'NSF Policies `[See, for example, @Briney_2015]`
1. At the bottom of the document, insert a new section 'References' with a level one header. Do not add any content to this section. Pandoc will insert, inside this References section, the full references for each of the citations embedded in the document 
1. In the YAML, add the following line at the end of the section (above the closing three dashes.)

```
output: html_document
bibliography: references.bib
---
```
Save the changes, `knit`, and close the file DMP3.Rmd 

# Formatting the Document as a Whole

## Table of Contents

In the Files panel of RStudio, copy DMP3.Rmd as DMP4.Rmd using the 'More' pull down menu. Open DMP4.Rmd to continue working.

To generate a Table of Contents for the HTML and Word outputs, we need to add a new line to the YAML output sections:

```
output:
  html_document: 
    toc: TRUE
    toc_depth: 2
 word_document:
   toc: TRUE
   toc_depth: 2
.
.
---
```
Knit to HTML and Word to view the results.
    
In the HTML output, Table of Contents can also be floated to the left of the rendered document, by adding an additional line to the output section of the YAML:

```
output:
  html_document: 
    toc: TRUE
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: TRUE
 word_document:
   toc: TRUE
   toc_depth: 2
.
.
---
```
Knit to HTML to see view the results.

## Section Numbering

_Note: From this point on, we will only be knitting to HTML. The features added from hereon in do not work in Word without adding a specific Word style sheet (more advanced level!), or the features just break the pandoc to Word conversion! _

The sections of your DMP can be automatically numbered by adding yet another line to the output section of the YAML:

```
output:
  html_document: 
    toc: TRUE
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: TRUE
    number_sections: TRUE
.
.
---
```

Before `knit`ting, remove the manually added section numbers in your DMP.

Also, avoid auto-numbering relevant sections (Main Heading, Background, References) by inserting `{-}` to the end of the heading. 

Now go ahead and `knit` to HTML.

## Set a style for the HTML output

The html_document engine uses the [Bootswatch theme library](https://bootswatch.com/) to support different styles of the document. This is a quick and easy way to polish the appearance of your document. (You may also apply Cascading Stylesheets to your HTML output but this, too, is an advanced feature!)

The following themes work well in RMarkdown:
cerulean, journal, flaky, darkly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, or yeti

You may also apply a Highlight style to the HTML document. For the purposes of this exercise, let's use lumen, tango or github.

Here is an example of a YAML output section with the theme and highlight applied:

```
output:
  html_document:
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: yes 
    number_sections: yes
    theme: journal
    highlight: github
.

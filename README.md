Author Carpentry : Open Authorship and Reproducible Reporting with Markdown and Pandoc: A Gentle Introduction
=======

*Content Contributors: Gail Clement, Tom Morrell,  Patrick Koppula, Sebastian Karcher*

*Lesson Maintainers: None*

**Lesson status: In Development**

## What you will learn:

During this lesson, participants will:

- Review examples of reproducible research compendia that combine "the whole tale" of an investigation -- the narrative, computer code, resulting plots, and data -- in one coherent package or presentation
- Explain why the genre of the reproducible research compendium improves on the traditional static scientific paper, whether published in print or as 'digital paper' (PDF) 
- Describe the benefits of writing in plain text for not only the author but for potential readers, both human and machine
- Apply the text-based markup syntax Markdown to produce an informative, expressive, and polished-looking research output
- Apply the universal document conversion tool Pandoc to render a single markdown file into multiple types of outputs and formats for various uses
- Practice using Markdown and Pandoc both at the command line and via the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Credit: This lesson idea was inspired by the Sustainable Authorship lesson developed and delivered by Programming Historian: http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown. AuthorCarpentry instructors are adapting it as a prerequisite module for our Reproducible Reporting curriculum.
